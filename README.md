This is research aimed at increasing military superiority, suddenly everyone is going after humanoid robots, the way everyone was going after nuclear research, the future wars will be fought with these things, 
best of the best will win the war, we will teach it combat, CQC and use of guns, I dont think Boston Dynamics are making robots to do cooking, Tesla is even saying its for warehouse management, 
This is through research, we are early, I need someone to fund my research,  the wars of the future will be fought with these robots, at least for those that will have them, if you can build one, that shoots properly, you can make a million, 
It turns like a freak,
